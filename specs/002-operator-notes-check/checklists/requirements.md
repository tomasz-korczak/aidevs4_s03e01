# Specification Quality Checklist: Operator Notes Issue Check

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 (2026-08-04): FR-003 initially named Spring AI/OpenRouter; moved stack detail to Assumptions; FR now says “AI language model”.
- Spring AI / OpenRouter appear only under Assumptions (constitution-aligned delivery choice), not as stakeholder requirements.
- Constitution Principle II conflict is explicitly called out in Assumptions for planning to amend governance before implementation completes.
- Assumed hub payload = finalized invalid basenames; planning should confirm against hub contract.
